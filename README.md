# BreastCancerDetection

This project contains the developed coded related to my Bachelor's thesis: Breast cancer detection with neural networks



## Goals

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the use of neural networks for the detection and classification of BC through image analysis of mammography and breast ultrasound. By training a Transformers and CNN-based machine learning model with ultrasounds retrieved from the Breast Ultrasound Image (BUSI) dataset and mammograms retrieved from the Chinese mammography dataset, the aim is to train the model to identify the shape, texture, and density of breast tumours for later classification of the images for clinical diagnosis. 
## Dataset

For the training and testing of the project, the Breast Ultrasound Image (BUSI) dataset was utilized. 

To download the data, follow the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset

After loading the data, it was uploaded to a Google Drive folder, connected with the code. 

## Content

Inside the github folder you may find the Jupiter Notebook utilized for the development of the project. Dataset could not be uploaded due to excessive size. 

The Notebook was developed using Google Collab. 
## Use

To use this project, download the database from the provided URL in section Dataset. 

In case of running the code on another environment, please make sure you have all the necessary dependencies. 

If you are going to run the code on the Google Colab environment, please note that the project was developed using a PRO license account. This account allows the usage of A100. With the GPUs available in the free account, you will not be able to compile the Transformers section of the project due to memory issues.
